Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. The Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch a streaming service of its own and the data-related queries in this repository were used to inform the business intelligence department's launch strategy.

## Key Questions and Objectives:

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
